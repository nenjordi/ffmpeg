1) API
------

* libavcodec is the library containing the codecs (both encoding and
  decoding). See libavcodec/apiexample.c to see how to use it.

* libav is the library containing the file formats handling (mux and
  demux code for several formats). (no example yet, the API is likely
  to evolve).

2) Coding Rules
---------------

ffmpeg is programmed in ANSI C language. GCC extension are
tolerated. TAB size is 4. The identation is the one specified by
'indent -i4 -kr'.

Main priority in ffmpeg is simplicity and small code size (=less
bugs).
