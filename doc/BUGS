- Sound is only handled in mono. The fixed psycho acoustic model is
  very bad, although the quality is surpringly good for such a model !

- the bit rate control is really not correct. 

- Only frame size multiple of 16 are handled.

- If you want a specific format to be added (I am thinking about
  MJPEG, H261) please tell me. Of course, the format you choose should
  be based on MPEG to be easily integrated

- ffmpeg can be used to generate streaming audio/video on a
  server. Please tell me if you are interested.
